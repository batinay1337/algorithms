       The technical explanation of every step to print out even a simple "Hello World" to the terminal
        can be as long as a book. To sum it up briefly in an abstract way, we can say that
        everything you write in a C++ file stored in the RAM of the computer in a sophisticated way then
        executed the commands to produce some output.
        The way computer stores variables/functions etc. in its storage area is by assigning a
        "pointer" (Turkish: belirteç/isaret) to the variable's address in RAM. As a computer/software engineer, you
        have to be familiar with "pointer" logic and its applications.

    /*
       The next example will print out what is the "RAM address" of the variable
       %p is the string format option to print out pointer (the ram address where the pointer points to)
       & symbol is used as "reference operator"
       THERE IS NO DECLARATION SUCH AS "reference a = 0x62febc" or  "pointer p = 0x62febc"

     In the right side of the equation, there is something called "type casting"
     which can be very confusing to understand from a brief comment such as this.
     Please learn the concept from a more detailed source if you are not familiar with it.

     The reason why you could not able to print out "character_pointer" as an address is because of a
    special condition related to char and the pointer declarations. When you declare char *some_name = ...
    the computer interprets that variable as an "array" of character values so, what is an array?
    Array will be the first data structure you are going to learn and use in this course.
    An array is a set of values of the same type stored in a contagious area in the RAM.
    Each of the values in the array can be accessed with a unique index or by iterating a pointer.
    Since the array is stored in a contagious area in the RAM, the computer assigns a pointer for
    the starting location(address) and other values can be accessed simply by iterating the pointer.

    The special condition of character and pointer is when you define a char pointer, the computer interprets is
    as an array of character values instead of the address of a single character.Since we have "string" type in
    C++ this type of declaration is not used too much however, it is an important feature to know.
